RHAC Records
============

Code in this directory provides functionality for the records report page,
where our members can see their scores etc.

The main functionality is:

* `RHAC_RecordsView.php`
  > The main code in class `RHAC_RecordsView`
* `form.html`
  > Unused (I think).
* `icons/`
  > A directory for all of the badges
* `rhac-records.php`
  > The plugin code that glues the functionality into WordPress
* `rhac_records_view.css`
  > Supporting stylesheet
* `rhac_records_view.js`
  > Supporting JavaScript
