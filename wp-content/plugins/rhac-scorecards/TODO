Members pages for viewing scorecards. -- DONE

Be able to show the following (indoor and outdoor combined):
    * Historical club records for this archer.
        * date achieved and previous record.
        * date lost and new record.

Be able to show the following (indoor and outdoor are separate):
    * Current handicap/classification (per archer/bow).
    * Current handicaps/classifications (all archers).
    * link to qualifying scores/scorecards.

Printable reports must not be forgotten.

User controlled "categorise by" option on each column, with category
order, plus "sort by" with sort order, "limit to" individual
values and "hide/reveal" columns should be enough to do all required displays.

Fix age group reassessment
    * on change of age group, the archer is reassessed on the last twelve months
      scores as if at the new age group.
        * the only way to do this? is to assess each junior twice, at younger and older
          with a new hidden column for classification reassessment.
