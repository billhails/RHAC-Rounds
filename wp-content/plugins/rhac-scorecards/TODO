Members pages for viewing scorecards.
    Admins can see all scorecards (admin page).
    Members can only see their own scorecards (not done).
    could present:
        1. Individual scorecard.
        2. Bar charts.
            a. By round.
            b. By distance + face.
            c. By date.
        3. Handicap and Classification (for the round).

Scores distinct from scorecards.
    Maybe foreign key allowing null referencing scorecard id.
    Then we can scrape the golden records html once.

Be able to show the following (indoor and outdoor combined):
    * All club records for this round/category/class.
    * Current club records for this round/category/class.
    * Historical club records for this archer.
        * date achieved and previous record.
        * date lost and new record.
    * Current club records for this archer.
    * Historical club records (full report).
    * Current club records (summary).

Be able to show the following (indoor and outdoor are separate):
    * Handicap/classification history (per archer/bow).
        * includes season-end re-assessment.
    * Current handicap/classification (per archer/bow).
    * Current handicaps/classifications (all archers).
    * link to qualifying scores/scorecards.

Printable reports must not be forgotten.

Admin has single "Generate Tables" button that rebuilds handicap,
classification and records tables, including doing all year-end
re-assessments. The actual reports are then generated on the fly,
and dataTables or similar JS filters them for viewing.

User controlled "categorise by" option on each column, with category
order, plus "sort by" with sort order, "limit to" individual
vales and "hide/reveal" columns should be enough to do all required displays.
