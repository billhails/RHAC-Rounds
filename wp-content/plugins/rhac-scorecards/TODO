Members pages for viewing scorecards.
    Admins can see all scorecards (admin page).
    Members can only see their own scorecards.
    could present:
        1. Individual scorecard.
        2. Bar charts.
            a. By round.
            b. By distance + face.
            c. By date.
        3. Trigonometric calculations.
            estimates of scores (linear interpolation).
            actual scores vs. estimates (performance).

Scores distinct from scorecards.
    Maybe foreign key allowing null referencing scorecard id.
    Then we can scrape the golden records html once.
    "Your scores for this round"
        inline with link to scorecard where available.
    "Club records for this round".
