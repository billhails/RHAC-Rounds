# Config Link

This plugin is, I believe, not currently in use on our site.
It was written as a convenience for linking to old HTML files
generated by a third party archery records keeping system.

The idea is that you configure the base url with one shortcode,
then another shortcode will generate links relative to that url.

Now that we have our own records system it is no longer used,
but may be in future for other purposes.
