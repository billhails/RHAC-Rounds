RHAC-Rounds
===========

A WordPress plugin to manage and display GNAS (ArcheryGB) rounds and classifications.

The classifications data in dump.sql and in the archery.db has been proofread and fixed via the admin screens of the running plugin.
The source of the data is the Archery GB Shooting Administrative Procedures document issued March 2013, available from http://http://www.archerygb.org/
which remains the authoratative
source. Any errors in the data presented here are totally my fault, though I have tried to be careful.
In any case the plugin gives you the ability to amend the data.

By the way, RHAC is Royston Heath Archery Club: http://roystonarchery.org/

The Hover plugin is a temporary fork in the official hover plugin by Stefan V&ouml;lkel - I've tried to contact the author but had no reply so far.
It supports longest match first and fixes a few bugs where matches overlap, for example round names like <q>Metric</q>, <q>Short Metric</q> and
<q>Short Metric II</q> tended to confuse the older version.
