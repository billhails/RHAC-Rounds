RHAC-Rounds
===========

WordPress plugin to manage and display GNAS (ArcheryGB) rounds and classifications.

The classifications data in dump.sql and in the archery.db is currently very suspect,
Perhaps only 70-80% correct.
I'm in the process of proofreading and amending it.

By the way, RHAC is our club: Royston Heath Archery Club: http://roystonarchery.org/
